        The map displayed above shows the percentage of the population that are
        considered dependent (ages 65+ and below 18) in the United States. The
        data was obtained from the

      <strong>Lesson 6 Reflection</strong>
      <p>
        While the complexity of the assignments continues to increase as the
        lessons progress, my understanding of JavaScript has gradually improved
        compared to when I first started learning the language. I'm beginning to
        comprehend the syntax as well as how it operates, allowing me to
        understand and write better code. Truthfully, I've succeeded and failed
        multiple times with the lesson assignments, often needing to try various
        approaches before arriving at a working code. However, the process of
        trial-and-error has allowed me to learn from my mistakes and gain a
        better understanding of how to solve my problems using resources such as
        the ArcGIS JavaScript API.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most significant challenge so far has been finding technical
        documentation and code samples that align with what I am trying to
        accomplish. Although The ArcGIS JavaScript API has been an excellent
        resource, I feel that it can also be insufficient at times, and I
        struggled to find specific scripts or code samples that I wanted to
        incorporate into my own project assignment. Another obstacle was
        encountering different ways to write code which can be confusing when
        looking for code samples. When this occurs, I find that I need to 
        take the time to dissect and translate the code thoroughly before
        implementing it into my own scripts. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, I recognize that the challenges are an important part of the
        learning process, helping me to develop my programming and
        problem-solving skills. Overall, I find web development and coding
        enjoyable and incredibly satisfying, especially when I solve a problem
        or when my code runs smoothly. That sense of accomplishment motivates me
        to keep learning and improving my skills.<br /><br />
